      While working in Matthias Preindl's Motor Drives and Power Electronics Lab
      I built the interface card above and put together the power electronics
      test bench below. The interface card is designed to sit on a TI launchpad
      controller but can also work with a BeagleBone Black or similar. It
      provides an array of power rails and translates logic levels for ADCs,
      encoders, SPI interfaces, and PWM outputs. The interface board includes
      an auxiliary board that can be positioned further from high voltage
      equipment to deactivate the PWM outputs or change their logic level.
    </p>

      The BeagleBone Black includes a PRU, Programmable Real-Time Unit Subsystem,
      that can be used to provide motor control decisions inbetween very high
      switching frequencies in a predictable manner. The challenge lies in the
      limited PRU resources, linking them with the SoC tools provided by the
      BeagleBone's main ARM controller. The PRUs can be programmed in Assembly
      but TI also provides a proprietary C compiler that I used during this
      project.
