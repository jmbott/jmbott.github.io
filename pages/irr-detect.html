        Irrigation Detect is primarily a data collection project. It asks
        how can I collect meaningful ground truth data at a lower cost than 
        surveying efforts? It explores using various sensors and street view
        cameras to do just that. With the GPS coordinates of your data capture 
        vehicle, a concept of which direction your cameras are pointed in, and
        how far away objects in the frame are, you can geolocate features of
        interest frame by frame.
