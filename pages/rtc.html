      Sometimes a simple small PCB is more fun to design. This is a series of
      boards designed for the purpose of keeping time during power fluctuations
      or outages.

      This first PCB is designed to sit on a Raspberry Pi. It has a slim profile
      and should fit inside most RPi cases. This board is designed for the
      DS1307 serial real-time clock. The DS1307 uses the I<sup>2</sup>C bus and
      consumes less than 500nA when the battery is powering the clock. The
      battery holder is large enough for a 20mm coin cell battery like the
      CR2032.

      A second PCB was designed for the Arduino Due or Mega form factor but
      includes an inverter button debounce circuit for the Due's 3V3 logic
      level. This can be left unpopulated for the Mega. To minimize the board
      footprint a 3V3 regulator is included. It uses the 5V power rail for the
      3V3 button indicator.
