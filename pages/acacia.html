      Acacia Irrigation has been one of my main projects at The Quadracci
      Sustainable Engineering Lab. Initially inspired by SharedSolar, another
      qSEL project, the focus is on finding a more economically feasible way to
      provide irrigation to smallholder farmers in the developing world.
      Initially as part of a USAID Powering Agriculture grant three pilot solar
      systems, 4.8 to 6.8kW, were installed in Gabar, Senegal. They provide
      irrigation water to twenty-one half hectare farms. This shared model
      increased the solar utilization with the design requirements of no
      storage and as consistent water supply as possible. There is no large
      battery array or water tower included. Water is distributed directly by
      means of drip lines or stored at ground level in basins for hand
      distribution. The motivation behind this design decision is economical
      and based on current farmer practices.

      The second iteration of Acacia is targeted towards commercial sales, away
      from a utility model. Inexpensively adding cloud-based control to off the
      shelf pumping hardware for individual farmer systems. It is easier to
      finance a smaller device and with remote data logging and control some
      maintenance can be provided from afar. If the market allows there is
      opportunity to sell monitoring services to the farmer as well. In this
      case, by serving a larger variety of customers, more farmers can be aided
      with a better service.

    <h3>Revision One:</h3>
    <p>
      The first revision of the Acacia system was controlled by a Raspberry Pi.
      I created a "hat" PCB for the Pi to integrate all the sensors and
      switches. A pyranometer and a temperature sensor are used to approximate
      shortwave radiation and PV cell temperature. Power available is estimated
      based on those readings. The board also includes a real-time clock for
      more accurate logs, an RS-485 to USB converter for reading an array of
      smart meters, and a transistor array for signaling the relays on the power
      electronics.
    </p>
    <p>
      A companion web application allowed for local payments, historical record
      keeping, and automatic scheduling. This revision taught me a lot about
      the Linux operating system, about Python, the Modbus communication
      protocol, and electronic prototyping. The three pilot systems have run
      for five plus years at this point, maintenance is sustained by a PAYGO
      payment scheme. With any luck they will run for many more seasons.

    <h3>Revision Two:</h3>
    <p>
      The second revision of the Acacia system is controlled with an Arduino
      style microcontroller. The intent was to simplify the controller as much
      as possible. Custom PCBs were created to interface with any off the shelf
      solar inverter or VFD that exposes an RS-485 communication port and a low
      voltage DC power supply. Only critical data is stored persistently and
      fluctuations in power are expected. On different versions the controllers
      either have an IR input or a cellular modem for communication with the
      cloud. The IR is for lower cost or out of network installations.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cloud connected IOT device needs a cloud-based web application. This
      revision communicates with that server where historical usage and payment
      data can be stored. This revision taught me more about C++ and minimizing
      memory usage; program memory but more importantly SRAM. The power
      controller communication can be simulated to simplify testing. The ability
      to properly test each component, software or hardware, can make all the
      difference in a production system.
