      Acacia Irrigation has been one of my main projects at The Quadracci
      Sustainable Engineering Lab. Initially inspired by SharedSolar, another
      qSEL project, the focus is on finding a more economically feasible way to
      provide irrigation to smallholder farmers in the developing world.
      Initial pilots experimented with a single shared point of solar generation
      with no energy or water storage and a Pay As You Go (PAYGO) payment system. 
      This decreased the initial capital cost for the installer while providing 
      cleaner, more convenient, and cheaper water access for each connected farmer.
