      SharedSolar is another of my main projects at qSEL. The goal of this
      project is to provide grid style electricity to rural homes, focusing on
      the developing world. There are SharedSolar minigrids in Uganda, Mali, and
      Bolivia. This project has gone through several iterations, I currently
      help maintain eight installations in the Isingiro district of Uganda.

      The current SharedSolar system is split up into three Arduino controllers.
      One to handle payments and customer interactions, one to maintain and
      protect the minigrid and user accounts, and a third to connect remote
      offline systems to a centralized cloud database and management system.

      I built this box below to integrate an NFC reader, an LCD character
      display, two user facing buttons, an ethernet controller, microSD card
      storage, a real time clock, and a few trigger switches. The main board is
      an Arduino Due that uses a watchdog hardware timer to reset on any
      failures. If there are any faults on the other main components they can be
      reset by the Due. Each component is in continuous communication so it is
      noticeable if one part fails.
