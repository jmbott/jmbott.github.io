      This is a digital artist archive that I helped put together. It showcases
      some of the works of the late Paul de Guzman who always wanted to start
      an ad agency called Guzzy's.

      My role in this project was to get the website working. My main focus was
      to display nearly two hundred photographs on a single mobile friendly page
      without overloading the user's device. To do this I used mainly vanilla
      JavaScript and a little jQuery. See the site linked below.
