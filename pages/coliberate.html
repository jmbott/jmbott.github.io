      CoLiberate was a company founded to solve the problem of access control
      systems in makerspaces. If you ran a shared work space with potentially
      dangerous or delicate machinery CoLiberate aimed to provide you security,
      allowing only those trained for specific tools to use them. Available
      products were overpriced and restrictive; there was an opportunity for a
      flexible and simple solution.

      I worked on a team to develop a second generation alpha prototype. It gave
      me a chance to work with <em>React</em> and <em>Redux</em> on a Node
      frontend as well as <em>Sanic</em> on a Python backend. Custom Hardware
      and software were both designed on the Raspberry Pi platform. BalenaOS,
      formally Resin.io, was used to containerize the IOT device software for
      easy updating and maintenance.

      The main three repositories for this project were open sourced recently.
      They can be found in the link bar below. My main focus was on the
      software running on the Raspberry Pi, `makerspace-access-control`, but
      was involved in testing all components.
