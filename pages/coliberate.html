      CoLiberate was a company founded to solve the problem of access control
      systems in makerspaces. If you ran a shared work space with potentially
      dangerous or delicate machinery CoLiberate aimed to provide you security,
      allowing only those trained for specific tools to use them. Available
      products were overpriced and restrictive; there was an opportunity for a
      flexible and simple solution.

      The main three repositories for this project were open sourced.
      They can be found in the link bar below. My main focus was on the
      software running on the local device, `makerspace-access-control`, but
      was also involved in testing all components.
