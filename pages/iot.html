      This project was for an internet of things class during my masters. It is
      the base for creating a network of RS-485 devices. Each device is equipped
      with a LoRa radio module that polls the different Modbus registers and
      communicates back to a central LoRa radio concentrator. The central unit
      is also equipped with an Ethernet controller to post accumulated results
      to a local webapp.

      This project uses a library, lightOS, made by a friend of mine to organize
      tasks on embedded controllers. It divides duties into small chunks and
      uses interrupts to call them on set intervals. The whole project is
      structured on this framework. Remote nodes listen for incoming
      transmissions, communicate to electricity meters with RS-485 ports, and
      store state information in memory. Central concentrator units periodically
      poll all the remote nodes and display the collected information locally.
      Arduino controllers made by Adafruit were used for this project. Further
      details can be found on the project github or report website.
